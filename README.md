This is a huge team project. <br>
Some codes are provided by the instructor and other teams.<br> 
I mainly worked on Backend Models and APIs: APIDailyBSLEntryController.java, BloodSugarLimits.java, and DailyBloodSugarLevelEntry.java.<br> 
I also worked on cucumber & selenium tests automation: BloodSugarLevel.feature and BloodSugarLevelStepDefs.java <br>
